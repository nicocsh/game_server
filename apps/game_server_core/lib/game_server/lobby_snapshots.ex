defmodule GameServer.LobbySnapshots do
  @moduledoc """
  Durable record of how a lobby's state evolved during a run.

  A lobby *is* a run — each level quick-joins a fresh lobby — so `lobby_id` is
  the correlation key and needs no separate id. A timeline reads
  `snapshot N -> [events] -> snapshot N+1`: snapshots record *what* changed,
  events record *why*.

  Two entry points, both cheap for callers:

  - `capture_lobby/3` at a mutation entry point (hook completion, game-loop
    message, lobby teardown).
  - `record_event/4` where a decision is worth explaining.

  Both enqueue into `GameServer.LobbySnapshots.Writer` rather than writing
  inline — call sites live in the serialized game loop, where a DB round trip
  shows up as gameplay stutter.

  Disabled by default; see `enabled?/0`.

  Capture the current state of a lobby, attributing it to `trigger`.

  `trigger` names what caused the mutation — `"hook:finish_boat_game"`,

  - `:sync` — gather inline instead of off the caller's process. Required when
    the state is about to disappear (lobby teardown), where an async gather
    would race the delete and capture nothing.
  - `:flagged` — mark the run as anomalous, exempting it from the default
    retention sweep. Set this when the mutation errored.
  - `:user_id` — attribution for the mutation.
