defmodule GameServer.Async do
  @moduledoc """
  Utilities for running best-effort background work.

  This is intentionally used for *non-critical* side effects (cache invalidation,
  notifications, hooks) where we want the caller to return quickly.

  Tasks are started under a `Task.Supervisor` bounded by `:max_children`
  (see the host application supervision tree). When the supervisor is at
  capacity, the work runs **inline in the caller** instead of spawning an
  unsupervised process — under overload the system degrades to synchronous
  execution, which applies natural back-pressure instead of growing an
  unbounded process count. If the supervisor isn't running at all (e.g.
  certain test setups), we fall back to `Task.start/1`.

  Telemetry: `[:game_server, :async, :overload]` is emitted each time a task
  is executed inline because the supervisor was full.
