defmodule GameServer.Notifications.Types do
  @moduledoc """
  The `metadata["type"]` codes a notification may carry.

  A notification's type is never read by the server — it exists purely so a
  client can decide how to render and route it. That makes an unregistered code
  fail silently: the server stores and delivers it happily, and the client
  simply never handles it. So the set is closed. `GameServer.Notifications`
  rejects an unknown code at write time, and this module is the list clients
  can rely on.

  Plugins add their own by exporting `notification_types/0` (see
  `GameServer.Hooks.Declarations`); those merge with the core codes below.
