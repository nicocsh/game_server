defmodule GameServer.Realtime do
  @moduledoc """
  Pushing game-defined realtime events to a player's socket.

  Core's own events (`updated`, `notification`, `member_joined`, …) are fixed
  and documented in `GameServerWeb.RealtimeEvents`. This is the escape hatch a
  plugin uses for events core knows nothing about — a quest counter, a boss
  spawn — without needing its own channel:

      GameServer.Realtime.push_to_user(user.id, "quest_progress", %{id: 7, step: 2})

  Delivery rides the user's existing `user:<id>` channel, so the client needs
  no new subscription. The payload is JSON; protobuf mapping is reserved for
  core events, whose schemas ship with the clients.

  The event name must be declared by the plugin's `realtime_events/0` callback
  (see `GameServer.Hooks.Declarations`), for the same reason notification codes
  are checked: an undeclared event reaches clients that have no idea it exists,
  and never appears in the admin runtime page.
