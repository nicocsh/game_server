defmodule GameServerWeb.RealtimeEvents do
  @moduledoc """
  Registry of every server→client channel event.

  Event names are bare strings at their `push`/`push_event` call sites, so they
  cannot be enumerated at runtime — this list is the enumerable source of
  truth. A drift test (`realtime_events_drift_test.exs`) greps the channel
  sources and fails when a pushed literal is missing here or an entry here no
  longer exists in the code, which is what keeps the two in sync.

  `pb: true` marks events with a protobuf mapping in `GameServerWeb.EventCodec`
  (sent as binary frames on `?format=protobuf` sockets; JSON otherwise).
