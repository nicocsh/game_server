defmodule GameServerWeb.HostSupervision do
  @moduledoc """
  The canonical supervision tree for a GameServer host application.

  A host app owns its own `Application.start/2`, so historically it also owned a
  hand-written children list. That list is not host-specific — it is core's, and
  every core feature that adds a process needs a line in *every* host's copy.
  Nothing enforces that, and nothing fails loudly when it is missed: a missing
  child means enqueues target a process that was never started, so the feature
  silently no-ops while its config still reads "on".

  That is not hypothetical. Before this module existed, one host had drifted by
  six children (`Cache.Stats`, `Cache.Sync`, `IpBanSync`, `Retention`,
  `Tournaments.Ticker`, `Matchmaking.Worker`), an unbounded task supervisor, and
  the lobby-snapshots writer — the last of which cost a full debugging session
  to find, because every other signal said capture was working.

  So the list lives here, next to the features that populate it, and hosts call
  `children/1`. Host-specific processes go in `:extra` rather than into a fork
  of the list.

  ## Usage

      def start(_type, _args) do
        GameServerWeb.HostSupervision.init_runtime()

        Supervisor.start_link(
          GameServerWeb.HostSupervision.children(extra: [MyHost.Thing]),
          strategy: :one_for_one,
          name: MyHost.Supervisor
        )
      end

  Set up the ETS tables and OS services children assume already exist.

  Must run before `children/1` is supervised: `Schedule.Scheduler` reads the
  table `GameServer.Schedule.start_link/0` creates, and the ban/geo plugs read
  theirs on the first request. Safe to call more than once.

  Core's children, in start order.

  Options:

  - `:plugins` — start `GameServer.Hooks.PluginManager` (default `true`). Hosts
    that ship no plugins, and test configs that load them separately, pass
    `false`.
  - `:extra` — host-specific children, appended after core's. Anything here is
    genuinely host-owned; if it is a core feature it belongs in this list
    instead, so every host gets it.

  Order matters and is deliberate: `Repo` and `Cache` before anything that
  reads them, `PluginManager` before `Endpoint` so hooks resolve on the first
  request, and the periodic workers last so a slow sweep never delays boot.
